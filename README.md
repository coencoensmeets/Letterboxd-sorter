## About The Project
The last few months multiple lists became popular on Letterboxd in which the films were sorted by colour. An example: 
[Arlo McLean's list 'color'](https://letterboxd.com/theslayerbuffy/list/color/)
Normally, sorting posters takes lots of time and multiple headaches. This code makes it easy. It sorts all the film a user has seen. It exports an .csv file that can be imported into letterboxd on 
[the new list page](https://letterboxd.com/list/new/) 
 .It also puts out an image of all the colours the code extracted from the poster. The last thing it exports is a plotly graph where all the colours are plotted by RGB value.

  ### Built With

The code was built using Python with the following APIs:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
